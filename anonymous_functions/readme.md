# ðŸ§  Java Anonymous Functions â€“ From Scratch

## ðŸªž What Is an Anonymous Function?
- An anonymous function is a function without a name.
- In Java, anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions.
- Java didn't support anonymous functions until Java 8. So if you're using Java 8 or later, you're good to go!

## ðŸ”§ But Firstâ€¦ Functions and Interfaces in Java

Before we dive into anonymous functions, we need to understand:

1. What is a function in Java?
2. What is a functional interface?
3. Why do anonymous functions need functional interfaces?

### âœ… 1. What Is a Function in Java?
Traditionally, Java uses methods inside classes. A method is a named block of code you can call to perform an action.

```java
public class Greeter {
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

Youâ€™d use it like this:

```java
Greeter greeter = new Greeter();
greeter.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, world!
```

### âœ… 2. What Is a Functional Interface?
A functional interface is an interface with only one abstract method.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunction {
    void apply(); // one method only!
}
```
Why are these special? Because Java allows you to use lambda expressions (anonymous functions) to implement them.

### âœ… 3. Why Are Functional Interfaces Needed?
Lambda expressions (anonymous functions) need to know what method they're implementing. Java uses functional interfaces as contracts to define the shape of the function.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Printer {
    void printMessage();
}

```

## ðŸ§ª First Anonymous Function (Lambda Expression)

âœ… Syntax
```java
(parameters) -> { body }
```

Or, if only one statement, you can skip {}:

```java
(parameters) -> single_expression
```
